## DO NOT COPY
These are my solutions, using jupyter notebooks, to the 
problems on project eurler. They are only saved here
for reference. If you are trying to solve any of the 
problems on their site **look elsewhere**, the integrity 
of the site and it's problems should not be shared, nor 
should they be solved by the help of others. These 
problems are meant to be solved by the user, and the user 
alone. Of course you are allowed to look up stuff for help
and reference, but this will only spoil the answers for 
you. Thanks for reading. Have a good day ~ Ant üêú
