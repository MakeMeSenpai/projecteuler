# projecteuler solutions
**DO NOT COPY!** These are my solutions, using jupyter notebooks, to the problems on projecteurler.net. They are only saved here only for refference. If you are trying to solve any of the problems on their site **LOOK ELSEWHERE**! The integrety of the site and it's problems should not be shared, nor should they be solved by the help of others. These problems are meant to be solved by the user, and the user alone. Of course you are allowed to look up stuff for help and refference, but this will only spoil the answers for you. Thanks for reading. Have a good day ~ Ant üêú
